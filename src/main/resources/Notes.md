### Difference between State and Strategy pattern:
- Both of these patterns are used to change the behaviour of an object.
  - In State pattern the Context can have single state, and the behaviours are represented by subclass of State interface.
  - In the Strategy pattern we don't have a single state, different behaviours are represented using different Strategy objects.
